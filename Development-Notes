Development notes
Trying to get in the habit of verbose note taking 

31 Aug 2024
Goal: Make the life regen on right side include number of actual replenishment like 1% + 24 (the actual number)
In functions.js: 
Change lifetotal variable to global so it can be read by other funtions
Change life_regen formula to include lifetotal and output accurate number (this is mainly informative if using prayer aura)

Goal: add minus eneby phy resists on right with the other minus resists
Index.html: add line for enemy_physRes below enemy_mres
functions: add line for enemy_physRes below enemy_mres
barbarian.js: add effect:5 to the skills_barbarian definition of grim ward to allow it to be counted in enemy_physRes

Goal: add phys facet type damage where other facet damages show on left
Index: add line for physicalDamage below mdamage
functions: add line for physicalDamage below mdamage

Fix evade buff from hustle not showing on right
Add evade to zon buffdata section of universal_skills
Add evade 0skill entries in BOTH places of basic_variables

3 Sep 2024
Goal: show aura tick damage for non-paladin classes (pally's can just hover over the skill to see it, others can't do that)
Items.js: add min/max properties for tick damage
item_metadata: add min/max properties, display format for tick damage
functions: alter aura entries (holy freeze/fire/shock and sanctuary) in getAuradata function to include the newly created min & max tick damage propeties. Need to account for sorc masteries, paladin synergies, and facet-type boosts.

Also added righteous flame damage back in, not sure when it was commented out in index

Removed Plague Wirt's Leg, oops. 
Added clarity on ES damage taken values not being able to go below zero
Added top navigation bar and background to give the builder a look that's consistent with the rest of, AND allows simpler navigation back to, the PoD web pages

1st week of January
Added runeword options
Added hotkey (SHIFT + left-click) toggle to make items ethereal; no more need to maintain eth and non-eth item versions, but it does allow for more things that don't exist in game like slammed eth and bow and set eth. It's a worthwhile trade off imo
More patch 22 updates
Started working on character import, enter char name, click ok and it pulls in class, level, stats, and skills. Not sure I see a true way forward because we can't account for all items, even things like a spirit in a long sword would require an absurd ammount of extra coding. Will keep poking at it and see how far I can go before it gets too unweildy. Might be worth the time, might not.

11 Jan
Got items to import from the api to a limited extent. Requires name matching work, some planner items have been renamed to accomodate this.
